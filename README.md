# LLM-Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) through hands-on experimentation with PyTorch and TensorFlow. This project is a self-initiated endeavor to deepen my understanding of machine learning, specifically focusing on the intricacies of LLMs, and to explore the capabilities of two leading ML frameworks. It serves as a learning diary, where I document my progress, challenges, and insights gained along the way.

## Project Goals

The aim of this project is multifaceted:

- **To Understand LLMs:** Grasp the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Large Language Models.
- **To Learn PyTorch and TensorFlow:** Gain hands-on experience with both frameworks, understanding their ecosystems and nuances.
- **To Implement and Compare:** Develop a basic LLM using both PyTorch and TensorFlow to compare their workflows, performance, and ease of use.
- **To Experiment:** Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and datasets to see their effects on the model's performance.
- **To Reflect:** Use this project as a reflective tool to document my learning journey, challenges faced, and solutions found.
